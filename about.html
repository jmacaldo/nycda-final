          <p>Hi! My name is Joven Macaldo! I am a 33 year old photographer and soon-to-be web developer from Brooklyn, NY! I’m currently a student at New York Code and Design Academy’s Part-Time Web Development Intensive Program (PTWDI). <br><br> Looks like you’ve stumbled upon my webpage! This personal website was created as part of PTWDI’s assignment. This page demonstrates what could be done with the concepts learned in class so far: HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. This entire page is available for your downloading and perusing pleasure at my <a href="https://github.com/jmacaldo" target="_blank">Github</a> page. <br><br>My creative background started in 2001 (16 years ago! Yikes!) as a budding photographer from San Francisco. Back then, digital photography was just getting popular - and more importantly, affordable - amongst the masses. I remember plunking down $400 of my own, hard-earned cash at a Circuit City (remember those?) to buy a 2 megapixel point and shoot camera. </p>

    <div class="col-sm-4 about-left">
          <p style="text-align: left">In comparison, the phone that you have in your pocket right now has at least four times the resolution!  It is with this camera that I started to build my sense of design and aesthetic. Like a lot of beginner photographers, I snapped a lot of “post card” cliche photos - you know - a photo of the Golden Gate Bridge, a close-up photograph of a flower, and pictures of sunsets - lots, and LOTS of pictures of sunsets!</p>

          <p style="width: 320px;text-align:left; margin-top:19px;">
          Although I was getting pleasure snapping these photos, I was getting tremendous pleasure using the camera, I was getting less and less satisfied with the photos that  I was taking at the time. They are “nice” photos for sure, but they were not memorable in that they look like any other photo that would not look out of place on a post card. Nevertheless I took these postcard photos,</p>
          <p style="width: 260px; text-align:left; margin-top:-9px; float: left;">  packaged them into a portfolio, and  submitted it for review at the Academy of Art College in San Francisco for a chance to  earn free tuition for a photography course for the summer. </p>

    <div class="col-sm-4 about-left">
          <p>It was at this school where I further honed my creative style - moving away form picturesque to editorial style/photojournalism. It was also here where I was influenced by a lot of the design students at the time, and I was favoring the use of minimalism with crisp lines, little use of color, and strong typography.</p>
          <p style="width: 300px; text-align:right; margin-top:10px; float: right;">
          Fast forward to many, many years later, I am now at NYCDA. I still have, more or less, the same style as I did back then. With the web development skills that I am learning from school, it is my hope to one day carry over some of the aesthetics I’ve developed from being a photographer into web media.</p> <p style="width: 250px; text-align:right; margin-top:10px; float: right;">My other two main hobbies are cycling and being a home chef. I currently live in Brooklyn, NY with my Fiancé, Martina, and a cat named Janek.</p>
